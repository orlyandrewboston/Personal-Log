"We are young. Heartache to heartache we stand,
no promises, no demand."

Love is a Battlefield

That song was the last song played right before
I turned off the engine and headed into work.

I hate Mondays. I have less than 6 months 
to create a resume, chart some tennis matches
and analyze it, and figure out this whole
data analytics process that I find fascinating.
